# OpenMRS ESM Cohort Builder App

The Cohort Builder is a tool in OpenMRS 1.0 in the Reporting Compatibility module (included with most OpenMRS installations) that lets the user perform ad-hoc queries for patients with defined characteristics, and combines multiple queries into more complex ones. 

## Running this code

```sh
yarn  # to install dependencies
yarn start  # to run the dev server
```
Once it is running, a browser window
should open with the OpenMRS 3 application. Log in and then navigate to
`/openmrs/spa/cohort-builder`.
